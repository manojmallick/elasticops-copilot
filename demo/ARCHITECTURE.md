# Architecture Diagram

The Mermaid diagram source is in `architecture.mmd`.

## Generate PNG (Optional)

If you want to generate a PNG image of the architecture:

```bash
# Install mermaid-cli globally
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Generate PNG
mmdc -i demo/architecture.mmd -o demo/architecture.png
```

Or use an online tool:
- https://mermaid.live/
- Copy contents of `architecture.mmd`
- Export as PNG

## View in VS Code

Install the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension to view the diagram directly in VS Code when viewing markdown files.
